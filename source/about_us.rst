About Us
========
CoinPL was developed as a hobby project, and was initially created by
Exley McCormick while working at AQR Capital Management as a researcher and
technologist. The project's original goals were to learn more about systematic
trading of cryptocurrencies and the Docker-container approach to building
production-grade software.
